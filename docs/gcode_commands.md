T0 selects the first extruder (in a multi-extruder setup, such as T0 for the primary nozzle).
M82 sets the extrusion mode to absolute mode, which means the printer interprets extrusion distances as absolute values.
G92 E0 sets the current extruder's position to zero.
M109 S210 waits for the extruder temperature to reach 210Â°C before proceeding.
G0 and G1 commands move the print head to the initial position (0,0,0) with rapid and controlled motion.
The F2520 commands mean feedrate for this rapid move

We really only care about G0 and G1 commands
Specifically, we are extruding during G1 and not during G0
